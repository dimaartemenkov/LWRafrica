Welcome to LWRafrica. This supplementary materials described in Acta Ichthyologica Et Piscatoria article "Length-weight relations of fish species caught from Central Eastern Atlantic in 2004-2017" (2019).

The study provides the length-weight relations (LWR) of fish species from the Central Eastern Atlantic region. Fish were caught in the pelagic layer of the West Africa coast by midwater trawl. The length-weight relations were calculated according to the equation W = a•T•Lb. In total, 17453 specimens belonging to 10 families and 13 fish species were analyzed: Beryx splendens, Brama brama, Trachurus trecae, Trachurus trachurus, Caranx rhonchus, Sardinella aurita, Merluccius senegalensis, Mugil cephalus, Scomber colias, Dentex dentex, Pagellus acarne, Trichiurus lepturus, Zeus faber. All data were collected from 2004 to 2017 within the Morocco and Mauritania exclusive economic zones. For some fish species, such as B. brama, T. trecae, M. senegalensis, S. colias and D. dentex the available LWR data are poor or absent. Therefore, the results of this study can be useful in fisheries management.
